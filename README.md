This tool is based upon the original Glimpse for Silverlight 3 written in VB.NET by Karl Shifflett.  For those that don’t know him, he’s a WPF disciple and one of the top guys in the XAML!

His blog post in 2009 on the original project can be found here:

Both tools make use of the excellent FloatableWindow written by Tim Heuer, a former Program Manager on the Xaml team at Microsoft.
